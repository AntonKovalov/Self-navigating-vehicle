# Self-navigating-vehicle

### Introduction
This project is dedicated to learning the basics of Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The main goal was to design a simple environment with obstacles and a vehicle in it. Through trial and error the vehicle is expected to achive a certain level of proficiency in navigating itself around a map.

To simulate the environment I used two python modules - Pymunk for physics simulation, and Pygame for rendering the game.
Tensorflow and Keras were used for creating the model of a neural-network.

All the code is available in [FILE]. I am sorry for the messy coding, since I do not have neat enough programming habbits, however I hope it will be understandable and helpful to an extent.

I have to admit that at the very beggining of the project I had no idea about RL and I knew very little about deep learning modules. I am extremely thankful for all the resources out there that helped me orient myself around this topic and allowed me to have a lot of fun and thrill.
