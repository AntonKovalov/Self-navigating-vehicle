# Self-navigating-vehicle

### Introduction

This project is dedicated to learning the basics of Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The main goal was to design a simple environment with obstacles and a vehicle in it. Through trial and error the vehicle is expected to achive a certain level of proficiency in navigating itself around a map.

To simulate the environment I used two python modules - _Pymunk_ for physics simulation, and _Pygame_ for rendering the game.
_Tensorflow_ and _Keras_ were used for creating the model of a neural-network.

All the code is available in [here](https://github.com/AntonKovalov/Self-navigating-vehicle/blob/master/main.py). I am sorry for the messy coding, since I do not have neat enough programming habbits, however I hope it will be understandable and helpful to an extent.

I have to admit that at the very beggining of the project I had no idea about RL and I knew very little about deep learning modules too. I am extremely thankful for all the resources out there that helped me orient myself around this topic and allowed me to have a lot of fun and thrill.

### Process

If you want get more familiar with RL I highly recommend the following sources:
*[DEEPLIZARD](https://deeplizard.com/learn/playlist/PLZbbT5o_s2xoWNVdDudn51XM8lOuZ_Njv) for theory and practice
*[Keon's blog](https://keon.github.io/) for great and very very understandable code
*[Path Mind](https://pathmind.com/wiki/deep-reinforcement-learning) for absolutely amazing theoretical explanation.
